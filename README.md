# FRCScoutingApp

** Work in progress ** 

Hi! I am working on this application that can be used to predict which alliances will win in a First Robotics Competition match using maching learning (mainly XGBoost at the moment.) It will also be able to suggest the best teams to recruit for your alliance. :)
